## Features

Create a full cloud deployment pipeline for your assigned application.

- Instantiate the appropriate server architecture
- Create, initialize, and load any databases
- Connect the application to the created database
- Automate the entire process with a CI/CD pipeline
- Connect to github and auto-deploy from master
Run all automated tests


## Getting Started

1. Create a directory on your local drive named `ghost`, then cd into the `ghost` directory/

2. Go to TryGhost Repo on github: `https://github.com/tryghost/ghost`, fork and clone onto your local machine.

3. Create an empty directory called `ghost_empty` and `cd` into that folder.

4. Run `npm install ghost-cli -g`

5. Run `ghost install local`

6. Run `ghost install` (make sure the node version is 8.10.0, Run `node --version`)

### Set up Database - Go to AWS Console 


1. Select Mysql
2. Select Dev/Test - MySql
3. Create new database

### Set up CodePipeline with AWS

1. Create a code pipeline called: `ghostpp`

2. Select github webhook and find `ghost` repo and add it

3. Select `Sample Application`

4. Create new pipeline.


## Roadblocks

1. In the instructions to install `$ ghost install local` make sure node version is 

`npm install -g n`

`sudo n 8.10.0`

2. When creating a database, the free tier charges $20.00. Which we decided to use local database.

	DB instance identifier - `ghostDB`
 
	Enter new Master Username and Password
	
3. Deployment unsuccessful

- Deployment onto code pipeline,resulted in server error

```
(TRUNCATED)...opt/elasticbeanstalk/containerfiles/ebnode.py", line 180, in npm_install raise e 
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['/opt/elasticbeanstalk/node-install/node-v10.16.0-linux-x64/bin/npm',
'--production', 'install']' returned non-zero exit status 1. Hook /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/pre/50npm.sh failed. 

```



## Quickstart Install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
$ npm install ghost-cli -g
```

&nbsp;

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
$ ghost install local
```

&nbsp;

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
$ ghost install
```
